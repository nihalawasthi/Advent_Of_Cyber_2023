<h1>AI-Assisted Security Measures</h1>
<p>
There are countless ways to exploit a chatbot, so how can developers keep up and cover all possible attacks? As humans, we can’t. But another AI can! <br>
The idea is to set up another AI to intercept user messages and check for malicious input before sending them to the chatbot. This other AI (let’s refer to it as the “Interceptor”) can be continuously trained on malicious inputs. The more people use and attack it, the smarter it becomes and the better it can detect malicious input. <br>
This, combined with a properly constructed system prompt, would increase the security of the chatbot. <br>
But this doesn’t mean that it’s 100% foolproof, of course. Clever ways to fool the Interceptor may arise, especially with novel attacks it hasn’t encountered before. <br>
Poking around a system long enough could unveil intricacies and loopholes to exploit.
