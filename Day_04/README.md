<h2>CeWL</h2>
<p>
CeWL (pronounced “cool”) is a custom word list generator tool that spiders websites to create word lists based on the site’s content.
Spidering, in the context of web security and penetration testing, refers to the process of automatically navigating and cataloguing a website’s content, often to retrieve the site structure, content, and other relevant details.
This capability makes CeWL especially valuable to penetration testers aiming to brute-force login pages or uncover hidden directories using organisation-specific terminology.
Beyond simple wordlist generation, CeWL can also compile a list of email addresses or usernames identified in team members’ page links.
Such data can then serve as potential usernames in brute-force operations.
